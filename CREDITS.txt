I would like to thanks some people that made this plugin possible. 

First of all, I would like to thank, of course, the creators of the Heroes 
plugin for providing us with such an amazing tool to play and mess with and 
enchance our experience on minecraft to extreme levels. Please keep up with 
the outstanding work!

Second of all, I would like to thank all the plugin devs that left their
plugins open-scourced. This allowed me (and still is) to learn more and
more of java and plugin making.

Last, but, certainly, not least, I would like to thank the bukkit/minecraft 
community, especially other developers, that are always there to help on both 
forums whenever starters, like me, need them. I hope that one day I can pay it 
back and help people arround with their issues and I hope this colaborative 
spirit never dies within this community.

Extra thanks to:
Andrew2060 for helping me understand some basic Heroes methods and how they work
SagaciousZed for helping me with file management
